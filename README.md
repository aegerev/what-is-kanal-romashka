# Kanal Romashka: No To Violence, Yes To Education.
This project aims to provide high-quality educational content for children and adults. It is inspired by the vision of Fred Rogers: "If we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health."

## Core Values:
* Whole-Child Approach: We believe in nurturing the holistic development of children by focusing on academic, social-emotional, and critical thinking skills.
* Educational Excellence: We strive to deliver engaging and informative content that makes learning fun and accessible.
* Community Building: We foster a sense of community by connecting viewers through shared educational experiences.

## Key Features:
* Classic Favorites: Rediscover beloved shows like Mister Rogers, Arthur, and Clifford, alongside newer additions like Smeshariki and The Little Mermaid.

    <h1>A World With No Violence And More Education.</h1>
    <p>"I feel that those of us in television are chosen to be servants. It doesn’t matter what our particular job, we are chosen to help meet the deeper needs of those who watch and listen – day and night!"<br/>
        -Fred Rogers, also known as "Mister Rogers"</p>

    <div class="left card"><img class="tile-image" src="./assets/images/whole-child.jpg" alt="everything that kids need to succeed">
      <h2 class="card-title">Here To Help Everyone.</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Young children need a variety of academic and social-emotional skills to succeed inside and outside the classroom. That's why Kanal Romashka utilizes a "whole-child approach" to preparing children for life, offering media that supports key developmental areas — from communication, social and emotional development, and critical thinking skills to literacy and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).
        <br/>
      All of this is combined with our patented "No Hosts, No Ads" protocol. We're here to help, not to hinder kids' educational needs.

      <h2 class="card-title">Friends For the Ages </h2>
      <p>Kanal Romashka is considered by many to be the "new PBS KIDS". Because of that, we're utilizing the PBS KIDS catalog - a catalog of shows that have helped boost kids' educational development. They need positive role models - Mister Rogers, Arthur, the Kratt Brothers - to help them grow. Add in shows like Smeshariki, Smeshariki: Pin-Kod, The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid: New Adventures, and Mad Money w/Jim Cramer, and you have the new PBS KIDS.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Approved by Fred Rogers Productions</h2>
        <p>This is a new era, which means that we have to be approved by a company in order to continue. Thanks to us using the PBS KIDS catalog, Fred Rogers Productions QUICKLY approved the channel. So expect to see Mister Rogers, Odd Squad*, and Daniel Tiger on Kanal Romashka. We're going to continue Fred Rogers' legacy if PBS doesn't want to. </p>

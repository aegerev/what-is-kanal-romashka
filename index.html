      <h2 class="card-title">The Whole Child</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Young children need a variety of academic and social-emotional skills to succeed inside and outside the classroom. That's why we here at NET utilize a whole-child approach to preparing children for kindergarten, offering media that supports key developmental areas — from communication, social and emotional development, and critical thinking skills to literacy and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) learning.</p>
